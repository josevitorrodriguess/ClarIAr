## What is it about?

ClarIAr is a feature intergrated with the TalkBack tool in Android smartphones wich implements Artificial Inteligence to describe images and whatever goes through the screen with more accuracy and details.
In other words, ClarIAr is a acessibility resource created to enable blind people to use their phones in a more efficient way!

## How does it works?
